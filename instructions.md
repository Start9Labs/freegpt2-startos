# Instructions for FreeGPT-2

1. Click `Launch UI` to access your personal FreeGPT-2 website.
2. Sign up by creating a user account.
3. Navigate to Settings > Models. Here, you will find an entry box titled `"Pull a model from Ollama.com"`. In this box, you can type the tag of the model you want to use. **We recommend starting with the `mistral:7b` model.**
4. After entering the model tag (e.g., `mistral:7b`), click the download button on the right. The software will automatically download the model.
5. To discover other compatible models and their tags, visit the [Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library). This page provides information about all the supported models. You can explore these models and choose the one that best suits your needs.
6. Please note that the size of the model you choose should not exceed the available RAM memory of your server. Using a model larger than your available memory could lead to performance issues or crashes.
7. Gradually explore larger models as needed, keeping in mind the memory constraint.

> **Note**: You should have at least 8 GB of RAM available to run the 7B models, 16 GB to run the 13B models, and 32 GB to run the 33B models.
